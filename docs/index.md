Wagtail Localize is a translation plugin for the [Wagtail CMS](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail). It allows pages or snippets to be translated within Wagtail's admin interface. It also provides integrations with external translations services such as [Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/) or [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/), and importing/exporting translations with PO files.

## Requirements

Wagtail Localize requires the following:

 - Python (3.7, 3.8)
 - Django (2.11, 3.0, 3.1)
 - Wagtail (2.11, 2.12) with [internationalisation enabled](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/advanced_topics/i18n.html#configuration)

## Installation

Install using ``pip``:

```shell
pip install wagtail-localize
```

```python

    ...
]
```
