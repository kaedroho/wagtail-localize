# 1. Project Set up

Welcome to the tutorial!

This tutorial will take you though setting up a new Wagtail site with a blog from scratch, and then translate it into
another language using Wagtail Localize. This tutorial doesn't assume any past experience with Wagtail or Django.

In this section, you will set up a very basic Wagtail instance.

=== "Mac OS and GNU/Linux"

    **Create a project**

    Open a terminal and run the following commands to create a new site called ``tutorial``:

    ``` shell
    # Create a new virtual environment in a 'tutorial-venv' folder
    # This isolates installed dependencies from other projects
    python3 -m venv tutorial-venv

    # Activate the virtual environment
    # Note: If you come back to this tutorial later, you will need to
    # run this again to reactivate the environment
    source ./tutorial-venv/bin/activate

    # Install Wagtail and Wagtail Localize
    pip install wagtail wagtail-localize

    # Start a new project
    wagtail start tutorial
    cd ./tutorial
    ```

=== "Windows"

    Before you start, make sure you have Python 3.7 or greater installed, you can find this in the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/python-39/9p7qfqmjrfp7).

    **Create a project**

    Open a new PowerShell window and run the following commands:

    ``` powershell
    # Create a new virtual environment in a 'tutorial-venv' folder
    # This isolates installed dependencies from other projects
    python -m venv tutorial-venv

    # Activate the virtual environment
    # Note: If you come back to this tutorial later, you will need to
    # run this again to reactivate the environment
    .\tutorial-venv\Script\Activate.ps1

    # Install Wagtail and Wagtail Localize
    pip install wagtail wagtail-localize

    # Start a new project
    wagtail start tutorial
    cd .\tutorial
    ```

**Create a database**

Next, migrate the database for the first time:

```shell
python manage.py migrate
```

That should create a file called `db.sqlite3` which contains all of the content.

**Create a user**

Now create a user called `admin`:

```shell
python manage.py createsuperuser --email admin@example.com --username admin
```

**Start the development server**

Finally, start a local development server:

```shell
python manage.py runserver
```

Open up a browser and visit `http://localhost:8000`. If all those steps completed correctly, you should see the Wagtail welcome screen:

**Log in to the admin**

You can get to the admin interface by clicking the "Admin interface" link at the botton of the welcome screen. Log in with the user you created earlier.
